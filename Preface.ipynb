    "## Aims and scope\n",
    "\n",
    "This book addresses an important class of mathematical problems (the \"Riemann problem\") for nonlinear wave equations.  This problem arises in applications such as fluid dynamics, traffic flow, water waves, and electromagnetic waves.  The solution of the Riemann problem captures essential information about the model.  It is also the key ingredient in modern numerical methods for such models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book aims to cover the fundamental ideas related to classical Riemann solutions, including their special structure and the types of waves that arise.  It will also cover the ideas behind fast approximate solvers for the Riemann problem, and more advanced concepts related to non-classical Riemann problems.  The emphasis is on the general ideas but most chapters will delve into a particular application to illustrate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the print book, we are creating interactive Jupyter notebooks with animations and other tools for the reader to facilitate a  deeper understanding of the ideas presented. This is a key feature of the book -- each chapter was first developed as a Jupyter notebook that will be available online and converted to latex for the print version."

    "## Book formats\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is being published in two media: first, the traditional print medium, in the form of either a physical book or an electronic PDF.  Second, as a collection of [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The print version\n",
    "Like any mathematical text, the paper (or PDF) version of this book includes mathematical descriptions and derivations.  It also includes figures, most of which are generated by short Python programs.  The code for those Python programs is included inline in the text at the same point where each figure appears.  The reader may choose to skip the code sections, especially on a first reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Jupyter notebook version\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.  In the electronic version of this book, each chapter is a Jupyter notebook.  These notebooks have some additional benefits not present in the print version:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Some of the code in the notebooks generates **animations**, showing how solutions vary in time or with respect to a parameter.\n",
    "  - Other code in the notebooks generates **interactive \"widgets\"** that allow the reader to vary multiple parameters or plot different quantities, in order to gain deeper insight and understanding.\n",
    "  - The reader can also **modify the code itself**, perhaps to vary parameters that we (the authors) didn't think of.  We strongly encourage readers to use this to satisfy their own curiosity and enhance their learning.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### How to access and run the Jupyter notebook version\n",
    "In order to run the code in the Jupyter notebook version of the book, you will need to have certain tools and libraries installed on a system.  There are multiple convenient ways to do this.\n",
    "  - With Binder:\n",
    "  - With Docker: follow instructions at https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book/blob/master/Docker.md\n",
    "  - On your own computer: follow instructions at https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book/wiki/Installation."

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The book includes 5 parts, each divided into several chapters.  The first two parts cover the fundamentals of exact and approximate solutions of Riemann problems; the remaining three parts delve into more advanced topics.  In a graduate course on hyperbolic conservation laws, the first two parts could be incorporated into the curriculum, while the later chapters might provide suggestions for student projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part I covers the classical theory of the Riemann problem and its solution, introducing the reader to essential concepts including characteristics; similarity solutions; shock waves and the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions; rarefactions and Riemann invariants; genuinely nonlinear and linearly degenerate waves; and entropy conditions.  Building up from scalar and linear hyperbolic PDEs, it culminates with discussions of the full Riemann solution for the shallow water and Euler systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part II (*not yet written*) introduces approximate Riemann solvers, which are an essential tool in numerical algorithms for hyperbolic PDEs.  This part discusses the most important approaches to such solvers: from simple Lax-Friedrichs and HLL solvers to linearizations, including Roe solvers.  Potential issues with these methods (such as the need for entropy fixes and lack of positivity) are addressed.  Part II concludes with comparisons of canonical approximate solvers for the shallow water and Euler systems.\n",
