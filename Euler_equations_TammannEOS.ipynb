    "# Riemann problem for Euler equations with the Tammann EOS\n",
    "We consider the one dimensional Riemann problem for the Euler equations with the Tammann EOS. The Tammann EOS, also known as stiffened gas EOS, is used to model almost incompressible fluids. It can be physically understood as modeling an ideal gas under very high ambient pressures. The Riemann problem we want to solve consists of the one dimensional Euler equations,\n",

In the supplemental material of the work <cite data-cite=\"delrazo2017\"><a href=\"riemann.html#delrazo2017\">(del Razo, 2017)<a></cite>, the reader can find an extension of the analytic solution to the case where the parameters $\\gamma$ and $p_\\infty$ in the Tammann EOS have a discontinuity. In the following sections, we will focus in the latter since it is a more general case. Although we will not provide here the full derivation of the exact Riemann solver, we will give the outline of how we can solve it.\n",

The system will have four different solution states, $q_l,q_{*l},q_{*r},q_r$ separated by the three waves. In order to figure out if the 1-wave and 3-wave are rarefactions or shocks, we will need to create a function of the \n",
