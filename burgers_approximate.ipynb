    "## How numerical schemes use the Riemann solution\n",
    "Although we have gone to great pains to determine the full details of each Riemann solution, much of this information is not used in a numerical implementation.  Typically a numerical scheme uses only the value of the flux at $x=0$ to advance the solution.  Equivalently, we can think of the scheme as incorporating only the net impact of all waves traveling to the right (or left) on the adjacent grid points or cells.  It's therefore not necessary to consider the internal structure of a rarefaction wave, but rather only the net change in the solution that the rarefaction wave leads to.  For this reason, we are interested in **approximate solutions that consist entirely of traveling discontinuities**."

    "Recall that the exact Riemann solution for \\eqref{burgers} consists of a single shock or rarefaction wave.  We have a shock if $q_l>q_r$ and we have a rarefaction if $q_l < q_r$.  In the case of a shock wave, we can simply use the exact solution as our approximation.  We have a single wave of strength $q_r-q_l$ traveling at speed $s=(q_r+q_l)/2$.  In terms of fluxes, the numerical flux is $F=f(q_l)$ if $s>0$ and $F=f(q_r)$ if $s<0$.  In the special case $s=0$ we have a stationary shock, and it must be that $f(q_l)=f(q_r) (=F)$. "

For this scalar problem, this \"approximation\" is, in fact, an exact weak solution of the Riemann problem.  As discussed already, we do not typically need to worry about the fact that it may be entropy-violating, since the effect on the numerical solution (after averaging) is identical to that of the entropy-satisfying solution.\n",

In this case, the true Riemann solution would lead to changes to both the left and right adjacent cells, whereas an approximate solution with a single wave will only modify one or the other.  This leads to an incorrect numerical solution (on the macroscopic level).  It is therefore necessary to modify the Riemann solver, imposing what is known as an *entropy fix* in the transonic case.\n",
