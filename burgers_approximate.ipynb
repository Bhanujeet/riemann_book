    "## How numerical schemes use the Riemann solution\n",
    "Although we have gone to great pains to determine the full details of each Riemann solution, much of this information is not used in a numerical implementation.  Typically a numerical scheme uses only the value of the flux at $x=0$ to advance the solution.  Equivalently, we can think of the scheme as incorporating only the net impact of all waves traveling to the right (or left) on the adjacent grid points or cells.  It's therefore not useful to consider the internal structure of a rarefaction wave, but rather only the net change in the solution that the rarefaction wave leads to.  Hence our approximate solutions can be thought of as consisting entirely of traveling discontinuities."

    "\n",
    "Recall that the exact Riemann solution consists of a single shock or rarefaction wave.  We have a shock if $q_l>q_r$ and we have a rarefaction if $q_l < q_r$.  In the case of a shock wave, we can simply use the exact solution as our approximation.  We have a single wave of strength $q_r-q_l$ traveling at speed $s=(q_r+q_l)/2$.  In terms of fluxes, the numerical flux is $F=f(q_l)$ if $s>0$ and $F=f(q_r)$ if $s<0$.  In the special case $s=0$ we have a stationary shock, and it must be that $f(q_l)=f(q_r) (=F)$. "
