This fictitious shock is not entropy-satisfying, but as long as it's traveling entirely to the left or entirely to the right, the effect on the numerical solution will be the same as if we used a (entropy-satisfying) rarefaction wave.

For this scalar problem, this \"approximation\" is, in fact, an exact weak solution of the Riemann problem.  As discussed already, we do not typically need to worry about the fact that it may be entropy-violating, since the effect on the numerical solution (after averaging) is identical to that of the entropy-satisfying solution.\n",

In this case, the true Riemann solution would lead to changes to both the left and right adjacent cells, whereas an approximate solution with a single wave will only modify one or the other.  This leads to an incorrect numerical solution (on the macroscopic level).  It is therefore necessary to modify the Riemann solver, imposing what is known as an *entropy fix* in the transonic case.\n",
