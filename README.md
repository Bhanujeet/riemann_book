# riemann_book
Book in progress to illustrate Riemann solvers in Jupyter notebooks.
@rjleveque, @ketch, and @maojrs.

We will start by collecting some things from the following repositories to work on: 
  clawpack/riemann, clawpack/apps/notebooks, and clawpack/clawutil
  
**To do:**

[ ] Add dropdown to static interacts to select variable
[ ] Phase space plots where you can drag q_l and q_r around
[ ] Sliders for sample q_l and q_r inputs (in phase space, also in x-t plane?)
[ ] Linked phase plane, q(x, t=1), and/or x-t plane plots as q_l, q_r change

**Problems**

**One-dimension**

[ ] Advection - conservative and color equation
[ ] Acoustics - constant coefficient and arbitrary rho, K on each side
[ ] Burgers' - with/without entropy fix
[ ] Traffic flow - scalar and systems
[ ] Buckley-Leverett
[ ] Shallow water - Exact, Roe, HLLE  (and with tracer)
[ ] Shallow water with topography, Augmented solver
[ ] p-system / nonlinear elasticity
[ ] Euler - Exact, Roe, HLL, HLLE, HLLC, 
[ ] Euler with general EOS
[ ] Reactive Euler
[ ] HLL solver for arbitrary equations
[ ] Layered shallow water
[ ] MHD
[ ] Relativistic Euler
[ ] Dusty gas
[ ] Two-phase flow

**Two-dimensions**

[ ] Elasticity
[ ] Maxwell's equations
[ ] Arbitrary normal direction on mapped grid
[ ] Poro-elasticity (?)
