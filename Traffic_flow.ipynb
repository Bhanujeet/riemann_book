    "In this chapter we investigate a conservation law that models the flow of traffic.  This model is sometimes referred to as the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (or LWR) traffic model (see <cite data-cite=\"lighthill1955kinematic\"><a href=\"riemann.html#lighthill1955kinematic\">(Lighthill, 1955)<a></cite> and <cite data-cite=\"richards1956shock\"><a href=\"riemann.html#richards1956shock\">(Richards, 1956)<a></cite>).  This model and the corresponding Riemann problem are discussed in many places; the discussion here is most closely related to that in Chapter 11 of <cite data-cite=\"fvmhp\"><a href=\"riemann.html#fvmhp\">(LeVeque, 2002)<a></cite>.\n",

Thus $q=0$ represents an empty stretch of road, and we can choose the units so that $q=1$ represents bumper-to-bumper traffic.\n",

    "We'll also choose units so that the speed limit is $u_\\text{max}=1$, and assume that drivers never go faster than this (yeah, right!)  If we assume that drivers always travel at a single uniform velocity, we obtain once again the advection equation.  But we all know that's not accurate in practice -- cars go faster in light traffic and slower when there is congestion.  The simplest way to incorporate this effect is to make the velocity a linearly decreasing function of the density:\n",
