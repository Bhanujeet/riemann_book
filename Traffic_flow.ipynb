    "In this chapter we investigate a conservation law that models the flow of traffic.  This model is sometimes referred to as the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (or LWR) traffic model (see <cite data-cite=\"lighthill1955kinematic\"><a href=\"riemann.html#lighthill1955kinematic\">(Lighthill, 1955)<a></cite> and <cite data-cite=\"richards1956shock\"><a href=\"riemann.html#richards1956shock\">(Richards, 1956)<a></cite>).  This model and the corresponding Riemann problem are discussed in many places; the discussion here is most closely related to that in Chapter 11 of <cite data-cite=\"fvmhp\"><a href=\"riemann.html#fvmhp\">(LeVeque, 2002)<a></cite>.\n",

    "Now we will think of $q$ as the density of cars on a road, traveling with velocity $u$.  Note that we're not keeping track of the individual cars, but just of the average number of cars per unit length of road.  Thus $q=0$ represents an empty stretch of road, and we can choose the units so that $q=1$ represents bumper-to-bumper traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also choose units so that the speed limit is $u_\\text{max}=1$, and assume that drivers never go faster than this (yeah, right!)  If we assume that drivers always travel at a single uniform velocity, we obtain once again the advection equation.  But we all know that's not accurate in practice -- cars go faster in light traffic and slower when there is congestion.  The simplest way to incorporate this effect is to make the velocity a linearly decreasing function of the density:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u(q) = 1 - q.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $u$ goes to zero as $q$ approaches the maximum density of 1, while $u$ goes to the maximum value of 1 as traffic density goes to zero.  Obviously, both $q$ and $u$ should always stay in the interval $[0,1]$."

We suppose there is a red light somewhere to the right; behind the light cars will be bumper-to-bumper, so we set $q=1$ for $x>0$ (supposing that traffic has backed up to that point.  For $x<0$ we'll assume a lower density $q_l<1$.  Intuitively, we expect traffic to continue backing up to the left, so the region with $q=1$ will extend further and further to the left.

Then the rate of cars reaching the line from the left is $f(q_l)$ and the rate of cars departing from the line to the right is $f(q_r)$.
