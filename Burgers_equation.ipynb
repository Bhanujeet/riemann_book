Rather than modeling a particular physical problem, this equation is the simplest equation that captures some key features of gas dynamics: the nonlinear hyperbolic term and viscosity, and it has been used for developing both theory and numerical methods. In a similar manner, Burgers' inviscid equation, which we will simply refer to as Burgers' equation, will allow us to explore the essentials of the Riemann problem for nonlinear conservation laws."

In this case, we obtain a triple-valued solution, which is unphysical.The first time this overtaking happens is refered to as the breaking time, which refers to the point where the waves break on the beach. It is also the point where the conservation law, in its differential form, breaks down. However, to understand what should physically happen at this point, we can solve the viscid Burgers equation while taking vanishing viscosity. What we observe is that a discontinuity in the form of a shock is formed, as shown below   "

As we are talking about conservation, it seems sensitive you want to conserve the amount of $q$, so the disconitnuity should be placed such that the areas $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the same. If we zoom in the region where the shock is generated, we can think of the $q$ profile as an specific initial condition for the Riemann problem, where the left and right constant values satisty $q_l>q_r$. Using the integral form of the conservation law, we can find the shock speed such that conservation is enforced. This simply yields the Rankine Hugoniot condition for the Burgers' eq."
