    "The use of the full jump $q_r-q_l$ in the wave discussed above may seem strange since part of this jump remains stationary at the interface (and part of it may be sent in the opposite direction!)  For systems where the flux depends explicitly on $x$, it is often simplest to use the $f$-wave approach; for a scalar problem this corresponds to using the jump in the flux, $f_r-f_l$ in place of the product $s(q_r-q_l)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique can be used in the present system, but it has a small drawback.  At the center of a transonic rarefaction, the cell average is $1/2$ and the $f$-wave $f_r-f_l$ will be essentially zero.  This causes the limiter to activate and reduce the method locally to first order, with the consequence that the solution is inaccurate near the sonic point.  The first approach discussed above (where the wave strength is $q_r-q_l$) is free from this deficiency."
